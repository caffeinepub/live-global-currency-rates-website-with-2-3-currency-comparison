However, because the HomePage diff is truncated and no other related files (e.g., AdSenseAd component) are shown, it cannot be conclusively verified from the provided evidence that the Home page contains exactly one <AdSenseAd /> instance and no other placements elsewhere on the page, nor that fallback behavior remains unchanged.",
