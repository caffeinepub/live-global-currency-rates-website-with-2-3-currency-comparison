However, the diff summary indicates additional AdSense ad placement and ad-slot configuration work that was not requested and may violate the stated non-goals (no new ad unit placements/layout changes).",

      "reason": "Only `VITE_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID` default configuration and ensuring the loader script is present in <head> were requested; managing multiple ad slot IDs/config modules is out of scope for the request and aligns with adding/altering ad placement infrastructure.",
